# Vendor-Performance-Analysis-Project
This project performs a complete data analysis on vendor purchase and sales performance using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) SQL (SQLite3) and Power Bl. The goal is to identify top vendors, high-margin low-sales products, freight inefficiencies, and optimize inventory decisions.
